# Maze Solver

A Python application that generates and solves mazes using the depth-first search algorithm. This project demonstrates algorithmic problem-solving techniques with a visual and interactive approach. 

## Features

- Randomly generates mazes of customizable sizes.
- Solves mazes using depth-first search (DFS).
- Visual representation of the maze and solving process.
- Adjustable animation speed for solving visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CEA2520/MazeSolver.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd your-repo-name

## Usage
- Run the main script to generate and solve a maze:

  python3 main.py


## Future Features (Planned Enhancements)
- Add other solving algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) and A*.
- Enhance visuals with customizable colors and themes.
- Allow user interaction to manually solve the maze.
- Create a "Race the Algorithm" game mode where a player competes against an automatic solver.
- Expand to 3D maze generation and solving.
- Add performance benchmarking for various algorithms.
